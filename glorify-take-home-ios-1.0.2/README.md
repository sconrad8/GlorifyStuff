# Glorify Take Home - iOS

Glorify is making a new iOS app that displays Blog posts. A rough prototype was quickly thrown together - now it's up to you to get this app ready for Glorify engineers to work on! 

To do so, you'll be refactoring the prototype to match practices used in the Glorify iOS app.

See [APP_WALKTHROUGH.md](./APP_WALKTHROUGH.md) for a reference of the prototype features.

## Instructions

The following is a list of practices currently applied to the Glorify iOS app. Your job is to **refactor the prototype to adopt 1 to 2 of these practices**. This is not a trick assignment! Rather, an opportunity to show us how you implement what you feel confident about in a relevant-to-Glorify context.

Elaborate on your thought process in [SUBMISSION.md](./SUBMISSION.md) on what you chose and feel free to share how you think about the items you didn't. The thoughtfulness of your implementation and SUBMISSION.md will be considered over the quantity of items you apply.

Choose 1 to 2 of the following to apply:

* Use Alamofire for network requests and Codable for JSON parsing
* Use the MVVM architecture for one screen
* Use programmatic layout over Storyboards for one screen
* Integrate the [Pulsator](https://github.com/shu223/Pulsator) library and use a yellow pulsing circle as a loading indicator

## Summary

* **Refactor** the prototype to adopt 1 to 2 Glorify practices
* **Elaborate** on your thought process in [SUBMISSION.md](./SUBMISSION.md)
* **Track** your efforts in a private GitHub repo

Email with any questions - and we look forward to seeing your handiwork!
